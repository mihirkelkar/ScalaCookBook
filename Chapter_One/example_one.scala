//The first and the only taske here in this example is to sho you that Scala actually leverages the Java Libraries and is built up on the JVM
//The following line gives us an example of what class a string belongs to. 
//IN scala everything , even variables are objects and all functions are methods
//of various classes by default
println("Hello, World".getClass)

//Get the name of the given class for a string
println("Hello World".getClass.getName)
