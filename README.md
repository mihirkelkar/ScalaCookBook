ScalaCookBook
=============

As I delved into Scala Programming over the last summer. I grew to love the language. I thought I should do my part and organize a basic tutorial of sorts for programmers trying to learn by example 

I will try and maintain an index here as to specific problems that we might come across during writing code and their solutions here. 

I will also try and draw parallel from different programming language constructs like those in Python to the equivalent in Scala.
