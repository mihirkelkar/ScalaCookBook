ScalaCookBook
=============

I try and finish the scala cook book in a week documenting the code exercises I practice and general notes here. 

I will try and maintain an index here as to specific problems that we might come across during writing code and their solutions here. 

I will also try and draw parallel from different programming language constructs like those in Python to the equivalent in Scala.
